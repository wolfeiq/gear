My therapist was right when she said the grief would change shape rather than disappear, and I'm learning that missing him doesn't have to feel like drowning anymore. I still have moments where the unfairness of losing him so young hits me, but I'm not spiraling into that dark place where I used to think I'd never feel joy again.

I know he's dealing with his parent's illness and everything, but the rational part of me keeps getting drowned out by this voice saying he's just using that as an excuse to avoid me. I brought this up in therapy yesterday - well, it was supposed to be last week but I rescheduled again - and my therapist tried to help me see other possibilities, but honestly I left feeling more confused. When I sent that last supportive text three days ago and saw he read it but didn't respond, I was convinced I could sense his irritation through the screen, like he was thinking \"why won't she just leave me alone.\" I keep telling myself to give him space, but then I spiral into thinking that silence means I've lost him forever and he's probably relieved to have an excuse to cut me out.",

The silence is stretching into two weeks now and I keep oscillating between understanding that he's overwhelmed with his parent's illness and convincing myself that he's probably decided I'm too needy or clingy. I managed to catch myself mid-spiral today when I started imagining him rolling his eyes at my messages, reminding myself that every time he's gone quiet before, it's been about his situation, not about me being annoying. It's exhausting trying to balance wanting to show I care with this constant voice in my head insisting he wishes I'd just disappear. I think I'm getting better at recognizing when I'm mind-reading, but actually stopping myself from believing those assumptions is still really hard.",

I couldnt react fast enough to stoped that but he just walked away. \nA random drunk men walked in the station now, bought a ticket and then started to talk random stuff and left. \n\nI am just so scared, i have to sit here alone for another hour and i feel like i am going to crumble down.

Yesterday I had to wait alone at a different station for about 20 minutes, and while I felt that familiar flutter of anxiety, I was able to use the breathing techniques Dr. Martinez taught me instead of spiraling into worst-case scenarios. My mind did briefly jump to \"what if something bad happens again,\" but I caught myself and reminded myself that most train stations are safe and that one scary experience doesn't mean every similar situation will be dangerous. The medication has really helped level out those intense physical symptoms I used to get - no more shaking hands or feeling like I might throw up. It's strange to feel like I'm in this steady place now after 16 weeks of therapy; part of me wonders if I'm truly better or just having a good stretch, but I'm trying to trust the process and acknowledge how far I've actually come.",

I caught myself starting to think \"this won't last\" when I felt good this morning, but I used my thought record technique and reminded myself that recovery isn't about perfection, it's about progress. My energy levels have been so much more stable lately, and even when I have an off day, I don't spiral into thinking I'm completely broken like I used to. It's wild to think back to where I started this journey - the all-or-nothing thinking that kept me trapped feels like a distant memory now. I'm genuinely excited about tomorrow, and that's something I haven't been able to say in years.",
