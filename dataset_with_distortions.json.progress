When I was sick, I set down my phone, my controller, and spent time thinking and getting real sleep. Because now that I am not sick and can be my normal self again, I cherish the world. I cherish that I can wake up and feel healthy and not vomit every five minutes. All those times I tried to kill myself feel foolish now.

Now he is slowly getting better (meds and lots of therapy) but he is still very much depressed. I am always the one having to text first or arranging a walk for example. And even then he would be like: sorry i am too tired. Or Hmm maybe one day, but rn i simply do not care.Its ok. I understand. Most of the time.But sometimes i break, especially since he has been so emotionless since he started meds.Last time he was drunk and suddenly started sending me snaps. (he never liked drinking and he is a real nerd. Its nothing like him to drink. Besides it influences his meds). So i got mad. I texted him that he is being childish (which he is) and that i would leave if he kept acting like this, because i do not recognize him anymore (i believe this personality switch is caused by his meds?).He is involved in self-destructive behavior. And his psychiatrist does not really tell him to stop doing stupid shit. His psychiatrist would be like: do whatever you like. So my problem: I am tired. I did many things for him: make a giant surprise box, two selfmade depression journals, drag him to the library with me, gave him summaries of classes, defend him around our friends, take him for walks, kept texting him.But Sometimes i break, and i hurt him. I know it makes him feel worse. Its because sometimes I simply do not understand why he hurts me so much. Why he can never truly say thank you for everything.I want to make an appointment with a therapist myself. To ask what depression really is and what i can do. How i can handle his emotionless state. And what i should not do. And i want to ask the guy i like if he thinks that is a good idea. (He already knows i read books about depression etc).He does not really talk about the way he feels. And tends to act funny all the time. I knw its fake. I even told him that. But for some reason he told me he does not know how to stop it and be himself.I also want to show him this sub.Any opinions about this? Or maybe suggestions?

Her mother wanted to have a house-husband for her daughter so that she can take care of her.

First few months was ok, her in-laws took great care of her. But after that things changed. Her condition worsened. She started coming back to her family, sometimes staying even for months. Seeing all this her mother started blaming my friend for not allowing her to keep a house-husband. Treating her badly. Always shouting &amp; screaming at her. At this point she shouts on her for anything!My friend is preparing for medical entrance exam, she wants to be a vet but all this is hurting her badly.

I am numb inside like just flat lined, nothing. I have had cbt therapy, counselling sessions, anti depressants before and whole bunch of other crap that only works for a short time. I slowly realised that most of my life has been trauma or abuse from family, environment, education, health, friends, girlfriends, life. I recently realised that a day does not go by where I do not get a fucking flashback to the past to a bad situation and that I do not have any happy memories. Being back at home for the summer with my parents till I am back at university has definitely not helped. I feel like I have accomplished nothing with my life. 28 years old, no savings, no life, living with parents that have issues themselves. I know I am not in a good place right now but I do not care anymore, I have no fight left inside. I actually want to die.I have always helped people, fixed shit that needed to, been the fucking foundations and rock for other people in the past and think to myself what wasted effort. As selfish as it sounds, no one actually cares about me, no one wants me, no one gives a crap, and this is something I have realised time and time again. I am always alone, everything I do, I do it by myself. No one shows up to any birthdays or they cancel for the last 15 years so I do not bother and spend it by my self. I feel like I fall in the cracks of every aspect of life. I understand that I should be grateful for the things that I have, but Id give that all up and do anything to remember what true happiness feels like one last time. I Used to make an effort with my appearance, health and with myself. Since corona, I do not care about my appearance anymore, I am losing my hair, I am gaining weight. I have lost the desire to drink\/ smoke socially. I have no faith or trust left in friends, family, teachers, basically most things, all they do is: disappoint, let down, pick on, bully, backstab or do something really dumbRecently I realised I have anxiety and have become and introvert. I have withdrawn from all social media and become a hermit. I do not even talk to anyone not even my sisters or step sisters. I do not know why I am writing this, I guess I have gone through so much crap in my life I am sick and tired of it all, sorry for sounding like a pathetic piece of garbage, but In all honesty I am not afraid of dying, at least Ill feel something.

At day time, working keeps my thoughts from wandering to undesirable things. But when I go to bed, I start to feel despair, useless, hopeless,...The scariest thing is, I could cry my eyes out at night and wake up next morning feeling \"hating\" myself being so miserable last night. But then the night comes again, things repeat. Last year there was one time I had shortness of breath and was so close to faint but luckily got myself go to the hospital.. After that and even now sometimes I still have these symptoms especially lying down, like my breath become shorter and lighter... I have not gone to the therapist yet. I have talked about this to my close friends but the thing is, when those episodes do not hit, I act very normally and cannot describe exactly what is going on with me. Every time I tried to seek advise about my problems but then my \"common sense\" is like \"no you are just exaggerating things, get a rest and you will be fine\". I am not fine at all.

I also don't find anything to do outside my house and that's why I don't even ask to get out of there adding how overprotective my parents are and when I actually do want to they just don't let me (I almost never go to my friends houses, I had a friend who didn't care when I went but hey, after 2 visits I couldn't anymore because of their paranoia and being overprotective, I don't hate them for that, not even mad, I just dislike how few chances I have of doing stuff like that)\n\nI think I am forgetting something.... I don't know.... I am not diagnosed with social anxiety nor seen anyone to tell me I have that, but I dunno my man, I am trying to explain my story but it's so badly structured that I just want to get to the point, I am a NEET and I am used to live on the internet just chatting with people through text messages\nbut today, I tried VRChat and I just.... couldn't talk, I wanted to, but I couldn't, most of the times I just think my voice isn't right for my words and a lot of times, I just don't know, I can't, maybe I feel insecure? I just wonder if there's a way to fix this.... I don't think it's deep\nI don't feel pretty good now, I was getting too bored in the game and I got tired of not doing a thing in VRChat, my plan was to be a silent person and interact with people but it's hard without VR, and it still gave me the chills to interact with them. I am frustrated because my voice... it isn't bad, but I can't think of a avatar who would fit it, my own appearance doesn't fit with my voice, and even though I know many people have appearances that don't fit their voices my words, my words are just what can't get out, by just thinking how it will sound or saying it to listen to it\nThis is annoying, I don't really hate my life, I had fun when I was 10 and didn't have any friends, just spent the whole time watching videos and playing game, and I still had fun when I got friends on the internet or people to talk to (ironically, people ruined that fun \"a little bit\" xd at the price of making it more fun) I am having fun now but now, well, I just handled depression I guess, but talking to people is still something hard to do for me, at least I got friends in my school, but I am still just too quiet and I am annoyed by that, I also find it almost impossible to start conversations, or just impossible (but, without speaking.... meh, it feels like there's no risk, I dunno, when I type I don't think I could mess up, not because of my voice, but it's still pretty hard, but I think that's how it is usually, hard)\n\nI wanna add that my family aren't something I can call friends or people to talk to, they have a lot of issues that are responsible for who I am now, I also almost never talk to them, specially when I just think there's nothing to talk about (with most people actually, but there's a fewer amount of topics with them)\nAnd well, that's my thing, I just want to know if there's something I can do, sorry for wasting your time, this is a mess, I don't normally make such a mess when I type stuff but this is one of the things I found the hardest to talk about (not emotionally), I usually make a mess when I find things hard to explain or to type, but this one is just the worst xd oh well\nat least I am not always like this, there are times where I just have energy",

Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.\n\nNow,\n\nOne of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.\n\nThis anxiety \/ fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this:\n\nWhether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?\n\nI experience symptoms of derealization \/ depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call \"reality\" or \"existence\" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.\n\nI feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as \"unimportant\" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25\/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?\n\nThis has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain. I have never been afraid of the 18 wheeler next to me on the freeway, yet i have always been afraid of the inevitable heat death of the universe. Why am I like this?",

I was always on 100 mg zoloft &amp; then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018, but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them. At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often &amp; have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts. Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone, but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol &amp; very depressed. So I got back on lexapro 20 mg &amp; after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before. August 2022 I started to get brain zaps\/dizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start. I worked my way up to 75mg &amp; started to feel a lottttt better, but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back. I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since. Very dizzy, lots of anxiety &amp; panic attacks, and the weird uncontrollable emotions\/thoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since. It gets A LOT worse at night and that\u2019s when most of my issues arise.\nWithin the last 6 months I\u2019ve seen an ear doctor to make sure I didn\u2019t have inner ear issues causing dizziness, an eye exam (I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phone\/computer or reading), and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist. All has always come back normal so I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s a medication issue or lack of something.

Went to the doctor to get antibiotics, took them for 5 days. 2 days later, I developed super intense middle super low abdominal pain that almost made me faint - Broke out into a sweat, couldn't stand, ears began ringing.\n\nWent to hospital where they ran some tests and said the infection was still there, so they gave me another batch of antibiotics. These made me feel super ill every night (btw, at this point, the UTI stinging symptom is long gone) and by the 5th night I felt sick af and was vomiting.\n\nWent to hospital the day after and I still had the infection. So, 3rd batch of antibiotics. Went to hospital the 3rd night because I was nervous I had a UTI that lasted so long. They told me I still had an infection and that it was severe, So I should stay at hospital. Didn't feel comfortable doing that in a foreign country, so I got on a plane to Melbourne (where I'm from) the next day. \n\nDad picked me up and took me to hospital. I did indeed still have an infection so they gave me a new batch and sent me on my way - I was asymptomatic at that point. 3 days later, I have muscle aches in my leg, I start feeling super weak, and my heart rate was really high (180 when I arrived at emergency) shortly after being admitted, I developed diarrhea. Doctor on duty thought I might have an undertreated UTI, so they administered new antibiotic via IV. I was discharged the  next morning.\n\nConsidering how long this UTI lasted, I followed up and had a new urine test 8 days later (last Monday) Called my GP's office last Wednesday and the results were normal (yay!) But was feeling worried because since Tuesday, I felt ultra uncomfortable in that region down there. Had an ultrasound on Thursday and went back to the doctor on Friday explaining my concerns. He told me my test results from earlier in the week were completely normal so it was highly unlikely anything was wrong. Gave me some tablets they apparently usually give to \"old ladies\" with bladder issues.\n\nStarted feeling okay Friday night and Saturday. This morning (Sunday) I woke up and started feeling the same horrible, sharp pain that almost caused me to faint in China. It's right below my belly button, but at the pubic bone and it's SUPER fucking sharp and intense \u2639 I've taken 6 paracetamol tablets today (spread out) But the pain hasn't completely disappeared. All this shit is making my hypochondriac tendencies go mental. It's almost 2:30am and I'm struggling to sleep because I feel so uncomfortable. I saw the doctor on Friday, I know, but this pain is fucking intense. Am I being paranoid or should I go back to the doctor tomorrow?

    "statement":"I will be talking this over with my therapist as well but more to the point, I \\*think\\* I may have finally found my... button? Fire? Motivation? I do not know what to call it really.&amp;#x200B;Perhaps I am getting too far ahead of myself here. Allow me to give you some information. &amp;#x200B;So essentially, depression is a static state of mind. It rarely changes. it is a very set in stone style of thinking. Of all the things I know, one major aspect I learned was that depression, or rather sinking into the thoughts and feelings of depression is very much like meditating. You sit there and focus on the pain, the regrets, the turmoil, those feelings of worthlessness, suicidality, hopelessness and on and on it goes and it is so hard to challenge those thoughts because they get SO loud.&amp;#x200B;So I have been studying, researching everything and if you look through some of my posts on this sub, you will come across some of my own theories and perspectives that deal with depression and functionality. &amp;#x200B;Ok, so niceties out of the way, let us talk about the plan.&amp;#x200B;First of all is the center piece, the schedule. I know I am low enough to need to schedule EVERYTHING. Bathing, brushing my teeth, sleep time and so forth.&amp;#x200B;However, I am also taking this up a notch. The way I figure it, I am either going to burn myself out and rupture or I will succeed. Either way, I will be out of this mindset, away from these feelings. &amp;#x200B;So in terms of what else is going to be added.&amp;#x200B;Tuesdays\/Wednesdays are usually my therapy appointments. &amp;#x200B;Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday are my gratefulness journal &amp;#x200B;I will be doing my own therapy session using CBT and I am thinking that will be once a week on Saturday to spread out between my therapy sessions and CBT sessions. &amp;#x200B;I am also going to force myself back into my old morning ritual. Pretty basic stuff; starting at 5:30am, get up, brush my teeth, morning meditation for 20 minutes, cup of coffee and breakfast, 30 minute walk, shower and shave, daily objectives journal.&amp;#x200B;I am also planning to add a self acceptance meditation into this perhaps twice a week, which will be a 20 minute meditation geared towards embracing my neuroses. Re-intigrating the fragmented parts of myself. &amp;#x200B;The basic plan right now is to hold this schedule for 4 weeks to build that habit and then I am looking to quit smoking. I have been smoking for 14 years now and it is about time I quit.&amp;#x200B;Along side all of this, I also want to add on one last aspect. I want to volunteer down at my local homeless shelter. This will give me an outlet for my energy so it is not so geared towards being used as fuel for depression and at the same time gives me positive feedback in seeing how my actions can make a difference. Plus any kinds of friends I happen to find as well as looking for references so I have something to show when I attempt to get employment. &amp;#x200B;I have been working on this plan for literal months, finding tid bits and pieces that I found crucial in forcing myself out of this. we are going nuclear. My mind does not have a problem sending nukes to destroy me, so it is time to return the favor.&amp;#x200B;I have got several tools for practical use against daily depressive episodes, such as the realization that I am literally meditating on that depression when I allow myself to sink into it. As well as a few other techniques such as bridging my thoughts, this means subtly changing them bit by bit. So \"this is useless\" becomes \"maybe it is not as useless\" or \"I will never be able to do this\" becomes \"maybe if I give myself a chance, I can do this\" things of that nature.&amp;#x200B;I have already beaten and almost entirely silenced the parts of me that were suicidal. So I know some of this stuff works. But that was target practice, it is time for live fire. The real deal.&amp;#x200B;Considering the tools I have got, the information I have and everything else, I believe it is time to make that change. I know I do not want to die like this. I want something more. But above all, I know the most important detail. This, all of this, it is just practice. that is all. It does not need to be threatening, it does not need to be scary. it is just practice. &amp;#x200B;But what do you think? Feedback, please? With a cherry on top?",

Last semester I was in dorms but due to covid they forced everyone to be alone in their room. No room mate, no visitors allowed, and you could not eat inside with others. With it being so cold, that meant you could not really eat outside either. Every day I would take my food from the dining hall back to my room and eat alone infront of my computer. If I hung out with friends I would risk losing my housing and being kicked off campus, so I mostly kept to myself. None of my classes were in person. Less than a month of being there I felt these terrible feelings i had never felt before. I felt deep loneliness and isolation and hopelessness. I felt suicidal for about a week and had multiple nights were I came close to attempting to take my life. After some time, I started to feel better. However throughout the entire semester I still felt traces of that loneliness and sadness. I have since moved home, and even now with family and friends and work to keep me busy, I still have regular multi day episodes where I feel empty inside and I feel like I have nothing to live for.Why is this still lingering with me? Can that one semester really be enough to because changes like that inside my head? Idk if I have depression and I am fairly certain I do not, but I have not tried getting diagnosed because it seems to be more of episodes rather than a constant thing.

In 7th grade I told my mother I didn\u2019t want to be alive anymore. She found a therapist and I started medication for ADD. It helped, and I continued taking it until I graduated in 2017. My freshman year, my friend had committed suicide. It never really hit me until his funeral. Where I promised to myself to never cause that much pain to the people that love me. I swore that day I would never commit suicide while I still have friends and family that love me. Just so I could never cause them that much pain. But I\u2019ve realized something changed in me or rather, hasn\u2019t changed in me since that day. I\u2019m not living for me. I haven\u2019t been living for me in such a long time. I\u2019ve only ever lived for the people I care about. Recently my 8 year long relationship came to an end. I tell myself it\u2019s for the best. That I couldn\u2019t treat her right anymore. That we grew apart. But she understood sadness and depression. She lived with it for all of her life. And I failed her by letting my resentment of our relationship get the better of me. I\u2019m proud she was able to leave me. I couldn\u2019t ever leave her, I wasn\u2019t strong enough. So now I\u2019m left with the realization. I have been living my life 3 months at a time. Never looking further because I feel that I will be dead by next year. Feeling like it doesn\u2019t matter what I do. I\u2019ve set myself goals and I\u2019m getting therapy for the first time in over a decade. But I can\u2019t shake the feeling of failure. The feeling that, no matter what I do, it won\u2019t matter. Because I\u2019ve masked this feeling since I was young. Because I believed the lie I was telling everyone. And now that lie is witness to the world. So my question is, Is anyone truly happy? Is anyone actually happy? Because for me, happiness was chasing a feeling of being wanted, being appreciated, respected. I could only catch small instances of it. So now I ask, how do I become happy again?\n\nTL:DR- Is anyone really happy? Can I feel happiness again? How do I be happy?",

    "statement":"I (19 M)was dumped by my high school sweetheart(19 F) a few months after graduating from high school which had me at my absolute worst due to covid and lack of social interaction I became totally dependent on my partner and became quite unhealthy physically in the process due to my hopeful lack of need to keep up appearances. I was in freshman year of online college at the time and I was completely unable to focus on anything school related because the thought of having to do that for the next four years by myself just made me want to avoid it altogether by just cutting it short. Along with not having any friends or any girls that I would even think of having a relationship with due to me being in a relationship during covid for over a year. It also did not help that I was very overweight and my self image was in the gutter. From that day I decided that I was going to lose my weight and get into the best shape of my life and gain my own confidence, but the loneliness honestly became pretty unbearable at some points and I did not know that it was possible to experience things like that due to what is going on in your head. Thankfully I reconnected with a best friend that introduced me to trade school and being able to make money while actually applying current knowledge which I was a fan of because I did not have any desire to go through college (I should add it was about 90% online) so fast forward about 8 months later and I am working at a dealership and taking concrete steps to work my way up while attending a trade school. Through the process I lost the weight that I had put on throughout high school (separate post on my profile) and I decided that I was going to try my best to avoid just spending my time in my own thoughts (because I am a very excessive overthinker\/overanalyzer). That I would instead only focus on the things that I am able to control at that moment to make myself better and improve for the future. Currently on meds and am starting to feel genuine joy in the little things in my life and am gaining appreciation for the things that I have as I work on building for whatever the future may hold. :) I saw a quote the other Day on Instagram that I thought was pretty good. Take care of yourself like someone you are responsible for Good luck everyone, keep working on the things that you can control :) From heartbroken and depressed to at least mostly optimistic",

    "statement":"I called them every name in the book. I was so triggered. Basically, this person said something to me over text and it seemed to me like they were being bossy and pushy. Basically they were telling me to \"hurry up\" and used verbiage like \"just tell me yes or no\" as I was explaining myself to them. That makes me upset. I am extremely sensitive and avoid most people because they hurt me easily. People feel like they can say anything to me so when that happens, I become instantly triggered and go off. When I was a kid, my mother and bullies used to always fuck with me and I had no one to defend me and was too scared to defend myself, so now if I feel someone is being rude and disrespectful to me, I feel like I have to speak up and sometimes that is done in anger and when I am enraged. I wonder if this has anything to do with my depression. I am a sweet girl but when I think people are being rude and disrespectful towards me, I get very angry and go from 0 to 100. I may send long texts and insult them, cuss them out, try to make them feel as low as possible, etc. The latest example of this is with someone who I did business with and bought something from. Basically something in the order was not done properly and then when I brought this to her attention, she got defensive and would not own up to it. That made me furious so I sent her a long text about how unprofessional and fucked up she was. I called her so many names. I do not regret it though as I needed to get it off my chest but this is a way that I have ruined relationships before by lashing out at them when things go wrong. I Am Enraged.

It feels like there is an asshole version of yourself inside your brain that constantly deflects all positive thoughts about you and intercepts it all. I am doing CBT and seeing a therapist every week, but I hate how these feelings rush over you and consume all of the progress you have made. I met this really cool girl 2 weeks ago and we have been having such a vibrant, interesting conversation and we have so much in common and looking forward to do things together. However, yesterday I smoke some weed with some friends (who I actually am trying to ween away from due to their different values, toxic men, etc.) and then all of a sudden I am having these feelings of not being good enough or cool enough for this dope girl I met. I am a man by the way and I find toxic masculinity to be something I really do not want to be a part of but I feel I am surrounded by men like that in my life. I am always looking at articles and posts about traits that are uncharismatic or make someone boring, and I objectively do not feel like any of those characteristics define me, but it still sucks that for every three giant leaps you take in confidence, it takes one day to have it crash down. My little brother yesterday told me I am extremely confident, and have been all of my life, and my coworkers always know I have a fun personality.

    "statement":"I am sorry in advance for this negative pretentious drivel. This just really needed to come out of me. |||Distrust, disappointment and futile attempts to escape hackdom is all life seems to be.||| 29 years old. I make money as a commercial music producer - music for ads, tv and sometimes amateur film. I am really starting to hate my job. I feel like I am lying to myself when I do it. My family are somewhat encouraging but I know they think I am a fuck up. I spend every bit of time (when I am not trying to calm down my anxiety or pull myself out of depression and when I do not need to crawl out of bouts of procrastination) on music \\- playing it, recording it, composing it, listening to it, reading about it. I have always wanted to be able to live off of my own art - but I have always told myself since the beginning (13) that this is a dreamers pursuit and to be realistic - to see what life is really like - and to know that this obsession will lead to nothing but suffering, alienation and potentially a whole lot of humiliation...but.... to do it anyway - because in the meaninglessness of life you should try to at least make it all about what you love. As I get older the idea of getting somewhere... and by somewhere I do not mean for fame or fortune.... but to make something people care about, to do something important in a way of giving back to culture - giving back to the arts that have not only saved my life numerous times, but made me feel exhilaration and love like nothing else has.... this idea of getting somewhere feels less and less likely. The most depressing part is that I do not think I have even properly put myself out there yet, that I would not really know how to --- That I move in so many different directions artistically, that I am so indecisive with what I want that it kind of seems impossible.... AND that this feeling of age is looming on the horizon. Like I am crossing over to 30, with my chances of any of this happening slipping away.Drugs and alcohol have now officially become about coping for me. it is not a party anymore. I hate socialising most of the time, I do not have social problems I am just really tired of it - especially when it is not music related - so I act up, get sarcastic and facetious and use the booze and amphetamines as a way around being irritated by everything and everyone. Which I feel guilty about... ...Because I know this is clearly just me being a miserable, selfish asshole. I cannot stand the incessant opinions of others - I never react to what is being said, I can even ignore it at the time but when I hear some of the shit that comes out of peoples mouths there is always a pain in me that starts and becomes more and more intense over a few hours. It turns into resentment, hate and then crushing sadness. The arrogance, meanness and the seemingly endless conjecture I keep hearing from everyone around me is excruciatingly distressing. I socialise less and less because of this. I live with a few older men - who all at one point tried to do what I want to do. It has not worked out. Now all they seem to have is marijuana, welfare cheques and a cynicism that is so dry, dull and invasive that just by proximity It can make you feel overwhelmingly despondent, dehydrated, hateful and high. there is a bitterness in them that you can feel through the walls of the house. Avoiding conversation is imperative if you want to maintain sanity with these types. Speaking with angry contrarians has never been helpful for mental wellbeing. At least not for me anyway. I have been through 3 long term relationships that all ended badly. The last one was particularly bad. I blame my apathy. Right now I am sort of in a casual relationship with someone who I suspect sees me as an ignorant pig. there is a lot of criticism about a lot of different things thrown in my face by her. Any conversation I bring up about commitment or what the relationship itself is meant to be is dodged. I am really starting to feel like I cannot trust this person. That they see me as disposable. I have already uncovered a few lies by them. Maybe I am wasting my time with a lot of people in my life. Maybe they are wasting their time with me. Every once in a while when I drink I think about killing myself. Every once in a while when I am sober I do as well. Some months way more frequently than others. Some days in those months it is for hours at a time. A few months back, I grabbed some stainless steel scissors and started cutting into my forearm. No one found out what the scars really came from. I had a bad excuse. I am still not sure if it was Just to feel something or to express my frustration in some way. Maybe it was for attention. Cutting myself for attention makes me feel an incredible amount of shame to just think about. But like I say I am not exactly sure why. I do not know where this is going, but I feel like I needed to put this down somewhere.. I have tried a shrink, I have tried family and friends. It seems to only be met with fear. I am sorry again.

I feel so left behind, and so behind in life. It seems that everyone else - or at least my friends - go through rough times but then find some sort of joy eventually, whereas my life is just grey and constantly disappointing. In every situation where me and a friend have been bonding and laughing over not having a relationship\/ job\/ or just being generally unhappy, they have gone on and achieved those things and every time it is just me again, alone in my unhappiness. &amp; I honestly do not think I will ever be happy. I have lost the ability to connect to new people -- I lost that a long time ago, or at least I feel like I did. I have not really made a new close friend in about 8 years, and I am 21, so that is quite a big chunk of my life. (Is that a common depression experience? the inability to make new friends?) I do not get crushes on people or feel the need to be in a relationship. I do not feel sexual attraction anymore. And because of all those things it means that I am just clinging onto school friends who are moving on in life &amp; making new and better friends &amp; achieving some form of adult responsibility. And because of my inability to connect to new people I just feel -- how can I be happy? I feel so strongly that I will just be forever alone &amp; lonely &amp; dissatisfied &amp; unhappy &amp; reminiscing about a period of my adolescence where I did feel happy, where I did feel connected to people, and like I belonged, etc. And people say \"well! you will not be able to make close friends or be happy with an attitude like that, will you!?\", which maybe is in part true, because obviously I have a very hopeless and negative outlook on life, but it is like, what am I meant to fucking feel or think? I have been increasingly unhappy for about 5 years now, and at first I had hope. At first I thought things would change. At first it seemed totally probable that life would not always be this way. But now I am totally hopeless and feel like things will never change. I just feel like everyone else has this ability to grow and change and \"heal\" from mental illness, even if it takes a long time. But I have been unhappy for so long now I just cannot foster any substantial hope for the future. And the fact that I feel nothing but a vague sense of bitterness and jealousy towards my friends who are now eventually in a good place contributes to my feeling that I am a bad person, among 100 other things -- and perhaps also a feeling that no one will ever love me because I am unloveable and intrinsically bad.

I was an academically strong student in my undergraduate program and went straight to grad school after because I really enjoy academia. I found my education to be so fulfilling- but now the spark is completely lost.\n\nEver since starting grad school my anxiety has NEVER been worse. I have always struggled, but not like this. I have panic attacks just from opening up my computer to do work. The thought of opening my email makes my chest hurt. Anxiety is showing up in other areas- I've had panic attacks because I was just convinced I was going to die within the next few days- because I just felt it. I have panic attacks when someone calls me, thinking they are going to tell me there's been some horrible tragedy. I'm convinced I see people with guns pointed toward me and I am going to be a victim of a mass shooting. I know there's something really wrong going on right now,\n\nAnd I'm so depressed. I have no drive to do things. The fear of consequences is building up my anxiety, but the thought of doing the thing just seems like the most impossible feat.\n\nI've barely submit any assignments- I keep trying to get them done. I tell myself that today is going to be the day I tackle even just one small thing, but this horrible feeling inside my chest and stomach just paralyzes me from being able to get anything done. I tell myself in 5 minutes I'll get up, it turns into 30 minutes, to 5 hours- then the next thing I know I've exhausted myself from just thinking about what I have to do &amp; I decide that I will try again tomorrow. Each time I try again, I fail.\n\nI wish there was a way others could see how much effort I am putting in- even brushing my teeth and taking a shower are demanding tasks. Eating isn't even enjoyable &amp; food doesn't taste appealing to me- I nearly gag with every bite trying to feed myself.\n\nI wish I didn't have to feel like this.

Its honestly devastating, as Ill be losing my main support, and I have grown to admire her as a person. Also, what will I do next year if I have a problem or something happens that she would normally help with? I will not be able to have emergency sessions with her anymore.I know this is possibly all sounding a little bit silly, but she has helped me a lot, and honestly?

    "statement":"Am I choosing the right mindeset? I wonder.. is it my stress, time management, or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can? Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me?\n\nI am a F14 in my freshman year of high school, currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions. I'm trying really hard managing between piano, soccer, and my grades with school. I love everything equally, (well maybe except school..), but in the end, my grades are my priority over piano or soccer. I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school, but grades are more important. But that doesn't mean I'm going to give up on neither one. \n\nBut here I am with a B- (84.5) in my history class, and I need to get it to an A- (90.1) by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months. Well I'll need an A- at least, so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year, and it's only available in my sophomore year as well. AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school, but it'll benefit me a lot, and as my school is very tough and competitive, I want to achieve my goal and do it. My teacher is crazy strict, being 87 years old, he has his more \"older-fashioned\" and more \"understandable\" ways of grading. So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards, but at the end of the day, I keep telling myself. In the future, there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them. I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements, for the future, to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more.\n\nI've never gotten a B, or a grade range in the B section (B-, B, or B+) throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now. Is it the stress that's piling on me after all these hard schoolwork I'm not managing well or enough with my time that I have? My sleep schedule is actually horrid, I usually sleep at 2-4AM waking up at 6AM, with soccer practice 3-4 times a week (usually I skip at least 1 day a week since it's a little too much), and 2 lessons of piano a week. Also including the clubs I've decided to join, Mock Trials, which is now coming to an end with competitions. Volunteering, which I guess I could choose which days to help out.. but.. The homework. The load at my school is actually crazy, about 2-3 assignments new each period, which is every day, so in a week total about 30-40 assignments, which is quite a buttload. It's due either the following days, or sometimes, a miracle as it is it'll be due next week. But then again, there's at least 1-2 tests a week, which I need to study a lot for. Oh of course, there's also the projects and essays, let's add about 1 for every other week. \n\nShould I take a break from piano or soccer, and put my grades at my priority instead? I think I can be able to take my grade, 84.5% up to a 90.1% at least, which is \\~6% of a percentage raise that I'll need to be okay. Telling my friends this, all I get in response is the same, \"It'll be okay.\" All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than \"it'll be okay\". I'm still new to the environment of high school, and figuring out what fits for me, and what doesn't fit for me. Encouragement, something I haven't heard in awhile, is what I hope boosts me. Thanks for reading this far.\n\nTLDR ; Not having the most decent grade in history class (84.5%), wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class, I need at least a 90.1% for my requirement to join the class. Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities, as well as school clubs, should I take a break from something? I need to put my grades before other stuff, including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well. Also wish someone could tell me, I'm able to do it, and they have confidence in me. Thanks again.",

I (26 M) am super frustrated with myself, today I had a cardiologist appointment bc I have palpitations sometimes and my heart races randomly when I have acid reflux.

I even asked him to order a take home monitor for me just for some peace of mind and he was ok with that. I had an echocardiogram done about 1 year ago with a different cardiologist and everything came back great.

I'm sort of new to the realization that I have HA, but it all makes sense now. I've always had anxiety, but it's definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago.\n\nA few months back, I had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain. I've pretty much figured out what's wrong there, but because of that, I've seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist. My doctor ordered a brain MRI with contrast just to be safe. I stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people (I strongly suggest you don't google it.) Anyway, after the MRI, I felt nauseated, which set my HA into a tailspin. \n\nNow, a few weeks later, I'm noticing that my feet, hands, and legs suddenly go cold, especially when I'm sitting down. I'm talking freezing cold, even if the rest of my body is warm. When they finally warm up, I get pins and needles all down my legs and today, I woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs. My scumbag brain is telling me I have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isn't curable, you know how it goes.\n\nMy feet getting freezing cold does happen when I'm not in what I would say would be a heightened state of anxiety. It usually sends me into a state of anxiety which I'm sure definitely doesn't help my extremities. It's a real chicken\/egg scenario.\n\nDoes this sound like anxiety to anyone or should I actually be concerned? I mean, I'm young (just turned 30,) I exercise about 4 or 5 times a week, I eat pretty healthy, and am all around healthy. In my mind, this should not be happening, but, here I am. I'm also worried that if I go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if I still have the dye in my system, he's going to think I'm crying wolf and won't take me seriously when something else is wrong.\n\nI definitely need the sage advice of other HA veterans. I'm new to this and don't know how to tell my brain to stop worrying about it. It won't, and I feel out of control, like I can't shut it off.",

I do not exactly know what I am hoping to get out of writing here. I guess I just needed somewhere to talk where it would not feel completely irrelevant. Lately it kind of feels like I am shouting into this black void hoping someone might say something back to me but its just echos of myself. I feel so so unbelievably alone every second of every minute of everyday. I have had diagnosed depression since I was 14 (I am now 25) so I know this will pass. I know Ill be okay. And I know that soon Ill be happy. But I feel empty. I am so sad and so exhausted from having to pretend to be okay because I cannot burden anyone. Whenever I try to talk to a friend it turns into me being their therapist and hearing how badly they have it. It makes me mad because its selfish. And then I feel horrendously guilty for being mad. I told my friend I had to cancel our plans and when he asked why I was honest and said it was because my depression was really bad and my intrusive thoughts about suicide (I have no desire to die. My doctor explained to me its my brains way of giving me an out. Fight or flight). He then spent forty five minutes telling me about how depressed HE is and how I am the only one he can talk to. I felt like I was drowning. To put all of that on me he would not even go to a doctor or a professional. He just expected me to take care of it. That was two months ago and I have tried to distance myself. I had another friend telling me how she tried to overdose on pills. And another asking me to go with her to get a restraining order. Its so much weight on me. I have absolutely nothing to give to anyone. I barely have anything to give to myself. I have my own struggles and I am trying to work through my very first real heartbreak and I am embarrassed that I am as sad as I am over it. Its just been hard. I am going to try to start going to therapy again. It helps to talk which is why I came here. I have no one right now. Sorry this was such a rambling mess. I just wanted someone somewhere to hear me and know how I feel. I do not know why. I guess sharing my feelings gives them validity somehow. Thanks to anyone who took the time to read. I appreciate it.Sorry again if I did not do this right. Its become a struggle",

Sometimes while huddled in bed in the midst of a panic attack I even involuntarily shake and yell out things to myself like \"Please I don't want to die\". Like the fear of death is so strong I actually blurt things out reflexively without being able to control it.\n\nThis is happening to me basically every day now and leading me to spend increasing amounts of time just lying down at home.

I was alone and in desperation i changed who I was to fit in with the people around me I started taking drugs,acting out like they would. This led to me being labeled as a mess and a druggie.After eventually seeing my relationship with my dad for what it was we fell out and because he is incapable of accepting responsibility he told people lies about me which caused the few people I was close with to stop talking to me.After a lot of years me and my mum slowly started sorting out relationship out but she in a state of depression took a overdose while I was at the home, she walked up to me and told me she had taken a overdose and if I loved her I would sit and cuddle with her.I called the ambulance and helped her into the ambulance that was the last time I saw her alive.At 26 I finally came out as transgender and lost the few friends I had made since adulthood I was still hated by anyone who knew my mum or dad.Since I came out as transgender my sister stopped talking to me and stopped me seeing her children because of \"what I might do to them\" the people around where I live went from talking to me to slowly acting horrible to me and eventually calling me names.Now I am 33 I am just tired I thought things would get easier.I have had problems with dizziness for years now and the doctors keep palming me off when before I transitioned they would always be helpful my vision is messing up I have issues with the shape of my corenas but I do not have enough money to do anything about it.I recently got back InTouch with my dad and I thought I would message his step daughter to make sure things were ok with us and that she was s ok calling me by my name and can accept that he is my dad too (she had said she could not call me by my new name and laughed at me in the past) I explained that I have always been good to her and there is no reason she should be horrible to me. I then got messages saying it was my dead mums fault and lots of other nonsense all I wanted was for his stepdaughter to call me by my name you know respect me? So I am sitting here now with no friends no family my vision playing up and feeling dizzy,not able to leave my home because of the fear I will be attacked for being trans I cannot get a move from here and the funny thing is I pass no random people can tell but because I lived here before people know and they tell anyone that will listen.I am so lost things are so hard I just do not know how to do it anymore I have tried everything and it is not helping.I have always been a good person always helped people out always there for people but I get shit on because people see me as a easy target so many people have come back into my life just to get something and then leave There is so much I have not gone in to detail on I hope this makes sense I do not know what I am posting this for I will probably just get abuse for posting I do not know I am just lost and need something or someone I just need help I do not know how anymore I just do not know how to deal with things anymore it feels like I have lost the ability to just smile and carry on",

The boys of my friendgroup started to seek a different group than mine so I was really pissed because they had no time for me anymore. I really tried to forgive. I am still trying to forgive them. it is just... I just cannot. They left me in my phase where I needed friends. I even told them that I need them. But nothing changed. They even forgot my birthday that we spoke about 2 days earlier. I just feel like I am worthless. Now their group ripped apart because of really fucked up shit and it is no surprise that they are with me again. And as I said I just want to forgive. Somehow. But I.. I just cannot. Something in me says it cannot. We met again, we played games again but somehow... it is not the same. I am always nervous and somehow frustrated when I am with the boys. It get's better after some time but if I think about the past again, what happens often, I am in a downphase again like now. Tomorrow is the birthday of one of my friends. I will congratulate him but there is just something inside me that makes me constantly angry when I think about his birthday. There is something that makes me sad when I think about my friends. My relation to my other friends, who are girls, is fine I guess. Even though my overthinking and lack of conversation skill really damaged it I think. I just do not have the strong bond I used to have. And I am never sure if it is me or the friend. They have problems too because of the whole lockdown thing so I am pretty sure that it is mostly because of this. But way too often my thoughts are not the same that I am feeling what makes some days really hard. After all I think they like me in a way but then there is my overthinking. Every word they say and every movement just triggers something inside me. I immediately think about it and take it as an insult or think of a sign that our relation is bad. And I think that is the actual thing that destroys my relations and I just do not know how to handle... I just do not want to loose them... I just do not have clear thoughts and wanted to vent a bit... This is so confusing for me and I do not know how to handle my feelings. Do you have same kinds of feelings and thoughts? Do you have ideas how to handle them? I wish you guys all the best with every problem you have.

    "statement":"Unsubscribing today. Thanks for all of your support. This sub has helped me through a lot of health concerns, but today I'm finally in a place where I can deal with it on my own so I'm posting to hopefully help someone else.\n\nI started off as a mess and eventually got a full heart\/body checkup including an MRI and wore a heart monitor for 24-hours to check out my palpitations. After being told that everything is fine that was a big step. Getting a professional, comprehensive medical diagnosis to rule out what you're worried about goes a long way. After chest pains, numbness, tingling in my limbs, dizzy spells, being sent to the ER because urgent care thinks I might be having a stroke, and a ton of other shit, something outside my control changed: my stress level. I took on a different role at work that is much less stressful. I had no idea how big of an impact this was because I didn't consider myself \"stressed\" but several symptoms subsided with this change like everything digestive and the chest pain is less frequent. After I was told the chest pains are costochondritis (inflammation of the rib tissues, read: stress-induced) I saw a chiropractor for about 5 months who taught me some stretches and self-adjustments I could do with a back roller and now I've trained myself not to panic when I feel those chest pains. Just do the stretches and trust that I'm fine and sure enough, I am. Also, my doctor told me to cut caffeine and I didn't listen. I am a coffee junkie and cut back, but didn't cut it out entirely. Well recently I switched to decaf (I know, stick with me) and it's been life-changing. Yes, this is obvious. Yes, we all know caffeine raises your physiological arousal level. But many of us keep consuming caffeine not realizing just *how* much it actually contributes to the cycle. I'm a much happier person on decaf and I don't think I'll go back. I found out all of the shit I was dealing with can be caused by anxiety. So this whole time, it was the fear of a health problem that was causing health problems. Stress impacts us more than we realize!\n\nSo to recap, here are the things my dumb ass put off doing forever that really made a huge impact:\n\n-Get a doctor's opinion. As in, a thorough one if possible instead of just a quick visit. They will run some tests and give you a professional take on it. When you get this - TRUST IT. If you have reason to believe the doctor missed something, get a second opinion but really you should trust the doctor.\n\n-Manage your external stress. This doesn't mean quit your job, but if something is stressing you out (a situation at work, a significant other, family) take some real steps to get out of that situation! In my case it was a lateral transfer and a change in responsibilities but man did it lower my stress levels.\n\n-Cut the caffeine and any other stimulants including recreational ones. If you struggle with anxiety, your brain is already pumping you full of stress hormones in a fight-or-flight response. You absolutely do not to make it worse. Even a little can impact some people (like me, apparently).\n\n-For the love of Reddit, never Google your symptoms.\n\nThe terrible thing about anxiety is once it has you, it's a downward spiral. But the inverse is true too. Once you are confident in your situation and know the quirks of your own body, you can come out of it quickly too. Hope this helps someone.",

Doctor felt with her hands and said they felt like normal lumpy breasts. I got an ultrasound and was told I have fibrocystic breasts. Cool! I could finally relax.\n\n\nA month later, I literally woke up one day and felt a \"pain\" in my right breast I hadn't felt before. I don't know if \"pain\" is what I should use since it doesn't hurt too bad, but I can definately and specifically feel it, and it's a sensation I don't feel anywhere else in my breast.\n\n\nEver since it randomly started that day, months later, it is persistent and I still feel it in the same spot. I'll feel it \"twinge\" throughout the day. It hasn't been getting more painful, but it is a specific sensation in the same spot (although sometimes when I sleep it'll feel slightly painful\/more pronounced in the morning, but then goes back to its \"normal\" sensation after I move around. It also hurts when I feel\/knead it with my hands, but so do many other parts of my boobs).\n\n\nDuring my cycle, my nipples will get sore a few days before my period, and then feel normal again once it starts - that is the way my breasts have acted during my cycle for years. This new specific sensation in my breast is persistant throughout the month, and I believe it's unrelated to my cycle.\n\n\nHas anyone had similar experiences like this?

Not that my situation cannot get better, but I do not see my mental health getting any better. It does not matter if something good happens, it either does not work out or the happiness from it does not last that long and I am back to my normal of being sad for no reason. I read something about how humans have a baseline mood, mix of genes and environment, but basically when nothings bad or good every person has a different level of mood. Mine is low, Ill find a reason to be sad, or I just will be. But reading that made me feel pretty hopeless because the study said that this baseline is pretty stable over your lifetime. Which supports my view that life is just one long hamster wheel of sadness for a lot of people. The latest bout of hope is I met a girl who is really attractive and thought I was too. she is really extroverted, I am not. We had a lot of fun together which culminated in us cuddling all night watching YouTube videos, that gave me hope. But of course it does not work out with her, after that night she ghosted me.This happens a lot, girls think I am physically attractive but for some reason they hate my personality. I am 23, I have never known what love is, just get teased about what it is. I have sex like once a year but I do not care, that is not what I want. I want emotional intimacy. Cuddling with that girl and making jokes with her making her laugh feel just genuinely happy, like a dark cloud parted just for a little. After it was over I was so anxious for 5 days that it would not work out, I could not eat, I was throwing up anything I ate, and of course my fear came true. Now I am just left with a tease of what love is but no idea still what its about. Now I am here, where I normally am, at the butt end of false hope, cannot get this girl out of my head, idk where to meet other girls. Lifes just one big hamster wheel",

We clicked immediately and started spending a lot of 1:1 time together and texting daily. * **I get rejected**The first girl initially accepted my dinner invitation without hesitation, but then texted me a few hours later to say that she was intrigued by me but still had strong feelings for her ex.

Everyday is a sisyphean nightmare, I scrub the literal shit just for there to be more shit. Endless shit, such is life. It\u2019s funny because everyone tells me I can do so much more, but is that truly so? I hate everything about everything yet have no real motivation to change. I\u2019m just so tired all the time. \n\nLittle background to paint the pathetic picture, I\u2019m in my late twenties and live with my parents. I\u2019ve had no remaining friends for several years now (for the better), have had a suspended license for 4 years, and my only sibling hasn\u2019t talked to me in years. My parents and girlfriend are the last remaining positive things in my life, yet personal guilt blocks my appreciation of them. I honestly don\u2019t deserve them. \n\nWhy they haven\u2019t discarded me like everyone else is beyond me. I\u2019m a pathetic, self-absorbed, alcoholic blister. The only time I don\u2019t experience crippling anxiety and the hollowness of my self- inflicted sadness is when skirting the line of a blackout. I have embarrassed my girlfriend and parents countless times. Despite my best efforts, I\u2019m not a likeable person, even when sober. I hate that I have to not drink two days a week, otherwise the familiar beast of physical dependence comes knocking on my decrepit door. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why I\u2019m even bothering to write all this. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m capable or even worthy of change. I got cleaned up and worked a 12 step program rigorously for over a year in the past. Tried to convince myself that I could even make healthy friends and live a normal life. I also went on Prozac, which made only a negligible difference except for the broken dick. That facade quickly crumbled once I realized that people like me are simply not meant to be happy.

WARNED ME how now that he is seen what I look like that it is going to be hard for him not to ask for nudes or get thirsty as he said it.. I told him to just talk to me how he always did those few days, just normal stuff it is obviously not hard and that I am a person too. Then he actually said and I quote \"yeah but that is before I knew you were attractive\".... He had the fucking AUDACITY to be offended by me saying our conversations are being ruined now because he could not control himself. So basically I cannot get the basic human respect of a normal conversation if someone sees how I fucking look? That makes me feel like I am nothing... I feel so fucking stupid for thinking this person was nice.. I have sat here genuinely upset by it for two days now.. When I explained that I should be the upset one and to leave the conversation there then he never once apologised. I am sick of feeling like an object... I am sick of being nervous when a guy talks to me.. I am sick of being scared incase they see my face.. I am sick of being scared full stop!! I deserve fucking respect!! I deserve to be treated how I treat you!!! I deserve to be heard when I fucking say no!! I have feelings and I am fucking sick and tired of all these thirsty fucking assholes who cannot accept it when they are wrong or acting creepy. I do not give a fuck if you are offended when I tell you that you are being too flirty...I am offended you would not listen to my no in the first place. Do I honestly have to hide my face just to get a normal conversation? I hate this shit!! Sometimes I feel like I want to hide away... I do not want to talk to anyone... Its already hard for me to make friends, I have to put up with this crap on top of it? I am tired... I am tired of not being treated like a human being. I have dealt with alot of years of past sexual abuse, physical abuse and I am a rape survivor of fucking several times.. So this shit just makes me feel even more worthless, my thoughts go back to how I used to think when I was abused... \"I am only here for his pleasure, it does not matter how I feel, what I want, I am just here for sex, that is all I am good for\".... It puts me in a really bad place. I do not know how to deal with this stuff anymore.. I know everyone has to deal with it, and it is just how the online world is but I feel like I have to ignore everyone just incase and I do not want to have to do that! it is not fair.. Why is this shit so scary..... I do not know who to trust. Do I not deserve some respect too?",

I do not want to become a lawyer in the first place, I just took this course since I was pretty much undecided as to what career I really wanted to have in life back then.After graduating at 20 years old, I was pretty much clueless. I am just taking whatever exams available, and although I passed all of the exams that I took, but I never got to use them at all.I enrolled in law school, but quit after 1 month because its not my passion.I passed the exams to be qualified as a policeman, but never entered the police corps because I had myself a tattoo before I even knew that I passed.Now I am 25 years old and spent the last 2 years as assistant in our family business. I thought I had a career going for me as successor to the family business until yesterday, at my parents reunion with their former colleagues and friends.I drove my parents to the venue of their reunion. My parents introduced me to their friends and soon after they talked about career and work. My dads friends kept bragging about their sons and daughters and how their parenting produced IT experts, licensed engineers, nurse, psychologists, doctors, ship captains, etc.I saw how my parents looked worried about not having to brag to their friends that their only son, at 25, still had no work experience outside of family business, and just lived off a small apartment owned by my parents.Conclusion, I really f*%ked up my life. If I could just turn back time and choose a more practical degree, I might have a professional career already, like the sons and daughters of my parents friends. But here I am, trying to learn and manage a family business because what other options do I have? If I refuse to manage our family business and my parents die or something, I am nothing. Knowledge in business is the only advantage I have left in trying to compete with these young professionals. Most of the time my contributions would go unnoticed which have led to my present state of hopelessness. 25, no work experience, felt like its too late to start over again and fix the mess I did back when I was still a bad decision maker.",

I did not realize I had it until mid 2019 because it came to a point where I was extremely empty, starving myself, and crying almost every night. I would hurt myself and even go to this bridge that was underneath a freeway and contemplate jumping or not. School was an absolute shit show and I felt like I was learning the most pointless things while I was struggling to battle my own mind so my grades started slipping.Admittedly Covid was the only thing that saved me and helped me graduate since I did not have to deal with anyone and did the work on the computer and because the schools would not let the grades drop even if you did not do the work (the grades could only go up.) I started dissociating emotionally since last year. Whenever anything remotely stressful pops up my brain numbs all emotions and I start to feel super disconnected from the world.As of right now, I am twenty years old and I feel like this constantly and it is really hard to connect with other people. I find it extremely weird when someone is crying because my brain has decided to disconnect all emotions when I start to feel sad or stressed out and everything just becomes meh and bland but it is been like this for so long that I do not even know if I will actually feel anything again. I do not even know why I am posting this because I do not feel like I am supposed to be here, but I guess I am just hoping that someone will see this.I literally feel like a ghost. Like I was not meant to be here. I feel like the people around me are not real. I always wonder why I was brought into this world. Everything feels surreal and odd. Whether anyone sees this or not, if you read it, thanks. I guess I just needed to vent my thoughts on the way I feel. Almost complete loss of emotions. I do not feel human.",

I have a tendency to shut people off and I have noticed, no matter how social I could be before covid to make it up like during weekends, party like nothing mattered, but after time people stop reaching out. And I never reach out because I am ashamed. I feel like shit every day that passes is worst on my self estime.I am not ugly I am not dumb but I was raised in a very abusive household and never developped sence of identity. I never been in a successful relationship, it was always I chasing the wrong guys or the wrong guys chasing me. Never said I love you to someone even though I felt it never had the guts (did not even matter he played with me anyway.I never had any recognition from my parents, family and now I have no friends anymore. Nothing but a cat.I tell myself everyday to go work out to have a self of worth at least for something in the day because I am tired of switching through the same 3 apps all day. I am just tired and hopeless for the future, for my future. I get uglier day by day and lose confidence as I stay alone and lonely but at the same time i cannot reach out to people. Most have lost interest and live their best life and it will only hurt my self estime more to be rejected again. I cannot take any more rejection. But at the same time I do not let anyone in anymore. I am at the age were people do not care anymore. I feel like I am waiting for my mom to pass away to take away my own life because she is the only human being that gave me just a little bit of love (of course with a lot of manipulation and hurt too). I just have an outlook on life that is so different now. Life is just not as cool and fun as it used to be.

I know what is wrong with me but I cannot fix it. I feel like I have been alone for so long now that I cannot get back. And tonight there is a free amazing party next to my place where I hear all the music and people shooting and it reminds me of the time I did that. I did not have to think twice I would always have plans on weekends.Now I have sports, my cat, Netflix and my memories.I want to be part of the 27 club more and more.

I'm due for a dental surgery and days before the surgery it feels as if I'm gonna choke on whatever is in my throat. At this point I couldn't even check my throat or put my tongue down long enough to look without gagging so much. I go through with the surgery, the surgeon says that one of my tonsils is larger than the other, and for me to get it checked out when I can. I go to my local hospital and they agree that my throat is swollen with a white spot (possibly a tonsil stone) along with swollen lymph nodes. He refers me to diagnostics for an ultrasound. This takes a month to do, because I live in a rural area and paperwork and such. Anyway, February 25th was my ultrasound and the results were sent back to my local doctor. He recommends a biopsy and CT scan this month. I may miss my daughters first birthday, and anxiety is through the roof. I had a family member give me a clonazepam once.

They also like to call me out on a lot of things or call me names just at random and it does not help my already not very mental state.

Last night I decided to use nutmeg balm to try and soothe the ache. This morning when I woke up and checked myself in the mirror I had this [rash](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/z5TaEWc) on the right side of my back on the shoulder blade.\n\nThe rash doesn\u2019t hurt when I touch it and doesn\u2019t seem irritated.

I\u2019ve used it before and never had a rash afterwards but after I applied the balm on my back last night I was sitting on a bare mattress, duvet and pillows, maybe it could be a reaction to that also?\n\nPlease let me know if you have had similar experiences or if I should go see a doctor.

This is a first for me at age 22, so naturally it was very impactful. Lately, her life has gotten busier, and I began to really feel her absence. At this same time, I had to go through putting down my family dog I have had for 12 years. This put a mental strain on me for sure, but thinking of her kept me going. Weeks later and she is still very silent. She is my co-worker, so I still try to talk to her, but I get an impression she has lost interest or wants to avoid me. I wonder if my impressions are large assumptions, but with the grief and anxiety I have felt lately, I take them as reasonable possibilities. All this has cascaded into some of the worst depressive feelings I have had in a long time. I struggled with it through my teens, but after being prescribed zoloft I saw improvement over time. What makes this hard is how uncertain I feel about myself. I think I put so much thought into her as my first, I was not prepared for becoming attached and the emotional impact of not feeling liked. Now I go to work actually scared to see her, since even if she will not decide to reject me or give closure, I dread the negative image I give of myself in my current depressed state. I am having a hard time seeing the other side of this, and while I think I am safe from thoughts of self harm, I feel I have lost a lot of joy and motivation to keep being myself.

    "statement":"I\u2019m Afraid My Mom Might Hurt Me So the preface, I\u2019m someone in my early twenties living with my parents. My parents have been fighting for years, occasionally physically. This would usually include my mom knocking in my dad\u2019s door to argue with him. These arguments would usually start with topics that included bills, taxes, or myself, that would eventually escalate to more personal matters I will not get into too much here. I used to try to intervene when things got too heated since they can\u2019t stop themselves, but recently I have decided not to so anymore as the last time I tried to intervene, my mom did physically attack  me (I didn\u2019t get hurt, I was just standing in front of my dad and she lurched at me).\n\nLast night, she called me to ask if I could knock on my dad\u2019s door, since he wasn\u2019t responding to her calls, because she \u201cneeded to pay a bill.\u201d I knew that this wasn\u2019t just about a bill, so I compromised and sent him a text instead, I even sent her a screenshot as proof. And I wasn\u2019t going to call him\/wake him up in the middle of the night unless it was an emergency, as I would consider it to be rude to do so. \n\nShe then says \u201cdon\u2019t worry your little head about, go back to sleep or whatever, okay?\u201d \n\nThen, she called me again, this time saying \u201cWhat are the consequences gonna be? Knock on the fucking door.\u201d I declined, saying I don\u2019t want to be a part of whatever was going on between them, and she should talk to him about this, to which she said \u201cI know. He\u2019s your loving dad, and I\u2019m the evil mom.\u201d \n\nI said goodnight to her, she laughs and responded with \u201cnot goodnight. Good bye.\u201d \n\nI say that I will talk to her tomorrow, and she replies \u201cI\u2019ll never talk to you again. Not tomorrow, not the next day, or the next.\u201d\n\nShe then calls me twice then immediately hangs up. \n\nShe calls me one more time that night, here are the things she said when I declined to knock on my dads door again:\n\n\u201cI ask you to do one simple thing, and you didn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s just a simple thing! I tried calling your dad, and he isn\u2019t answering me. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re picking sides or anything! Translation: \u201cLook at what I do for you! And yet, you can\u2019t this simple task for me? Well then I will rescind my love for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like you\u2019re picking sides or anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re full of shit, just like him (my dad).\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere has your dad been all of your life?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need to take responsibility.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs this what one of your councilors told you to say, the one that I pay [x amount of money, I don\u2019t exactly remember].\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even know what is going on.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut fine. You can do whatever- go to sleep, wake up in the morning, do whatever you do.\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cok. Goodnight, mom.\u201d\n\nAnd finally, I said goodnight to her, and she said: \u201cDon\u2019t call me mom. Just say good night.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not to say my dads innocent either or anything - he\u2019s hella toxic and has treated my mom poorly as well, so it is hard to tell where the abuse and victimization starts and ends between the two of them. Basically, they\u2019re both each others abusers and victims, if that makes any sense at all. \n\nBut I do believe he is the safer parent, as although he can, at his worst, make me feel very uncomfortable to be around him, as he is kind of an asshole at times, I don\u2019t feel like my safety is threatened around him, unlike with my mom. He\u2019s a lesser of two evils , if you will.\n\nSo I just feel really anxious right now. I did not want to be used as a pawn against dad, and my mom immediately associated me with him. So, now I\u2019m afraid that when she comes home, she will start to treat exactly like she treats dad, or worse. I\u2019m afraid she might start pounding my door and attacking verbally and physically. \n\nOkay that is all, I just needed to vent. Thank you for reading this.",

    "statement":"Arm aches\/ symptoms on one side of body Hey guys. I posted here before in mid December about having numbness and weakness on the right side of my body. I went home after finals week and my stress level dramatically decreased as I realized how well I did in my classes and I was able to decompress while at home. I went on a ski trip with my family in the middle of the break, right after Christmas, and I felt no symptoms at any time during that trip. I felt fantastic. As I came home and started to prepare to go back to school, I started feeling anxious that I would fall down into the same anxiety rabbit hole again in the second semester, and gradually the weakness and numbness started to come back. Now that I\u2019ve been back at school for 8 days and the anxiety has persisted (albeit less severe) I\u2019m still feeling tightness in the right side of my neck and in my right leg, as well as weakness and numbness in my right limbs. The symptom that is scaring me though is that my right arm feels dead, and I have aches in my shoulder and upper arm that really change in severity depending on the time and on what my arm is doing or where it is.\n\nI just feel so stupid about this. It\u2019s following the same trends as it did last semester and that all went away when I stopped stressing. Now I\u2019m stressing again, but for some reason my mind doesn\u2019t want to attribute this to the stress and I keep worrying that it\u2019s a horrible disease coming to claim my life. Anyone have any input on a situation like this?",

Then my cat died and I am in pain. I think my friend filmed my family in the toilet, there is lots of evidence to suggest he did. My mum told me not to call the police but I am stubborn and ignored her, I thought I was doing the right thing that maybe him being on record would help future victims and that if he has any content uploaded they could find it. The police interviewed me and I told them how he used to send me porn and how I think it might be connected due to the genre. At that the police seemed concerned and went outside to contact the sergeant. They said him sending me porn was another offence they would need to investigate. I panicked and insisted it was not a big deal that I was not bothered it was just a joke, I just thought there may be some connection. They said they need to contact the CID and that this is really serious. I am so scared, I cannot go to court, I have serious anxiety and depressive problems. All I wanted was for them to tell him off basically and put him on record, not this. This has gone way too far. Before the police left the constable told me I was doing the right thing and that I was brave. I do not think I am though, my friend could go to prison because of me! I hate myself so much right now. Later on my mum was driving me home and she told me my cat died. She was hit by a car which killed her instantly. I sobbed the whole way home. My mum kept her in the freezer and I needed to see because I was having a hard time believing it. She was cold and curled up like she was asleep. I sat there stroking her fur and crying. I feel like its my fault. We moved to the city near a busy road and since she kept escaping we decided to let her go outside. I was told I could send her to live with my father but I said no because he was abusive and mistreated her so I thought she would be safer with my mum. I moved away recently and could have brought her over but did not. I said the roads might be busy but I was far away from the road. And now she is dead. Its all my fault. I loved her and I am never going to see her again. And you know what is weird I actually felt really happy a few days ago, like really happy and confident, I was energetic and laughing and dancing about. Turns out that was the day my cat died which I did not know about. The next day is when I called the police because I felt so confident like nothing was going to go wrong. Its like I am not supposed to be happy, like every time I think I am on top of everything a string of things go wrong somehow. I thought about killing myself just to end it all so I do not have to deal with more loss or with going to court.

    "statement":"I created CocoonWeaver to help. It\u2019s a free, privacy focused app that sorts audio recordings, transcribed, into categories. There are numerous benefits to self talk, in particular it can decompress mental states and reduce stress. I hope you enjoy! Sometimes, it\u2019s overwhelming to think about all the stressful things. When you let go of them, you can take solace in the fact they remain in a safe space, but no longer occupying headspace. I developed CocoonWeaver because of a dream I had. My dream was about an app that would be intuitive enough to release the many fleeting thoughts that occupy ones mind. Since then, it has been developed in to a working product, and improved with the help of kind feedback from various neurodivergent communities. I would love to take feedback from this community as well, if you have a moment to download the app and share your feedback I would be extremely grateful. \n\nThe app is completely free and it is completely private, nothing leaves your device and everything is stored on your phone.\n\nThank you so much for your time! &lt;3\n\nHere are all the relevant links, to the app and website, android release date etc.:  [www.linktree.com\/cocoonweaver](http:\/\/www.linktree.com\/cocoonweaver)   \n[https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cocoonweaver\/](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/cocoonweaver\/)",
